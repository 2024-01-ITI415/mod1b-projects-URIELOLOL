# Module1-Projects
 
My prototype is a very simple chamber of secrets game. Based on Roll-the-Ball development, use OnTriggerEnter to trigger and enter new rooms, which makes it very easy to play more Rooms.

In addition, I used a third-person camera to follow, and limited the tumbling of blocks to prevent movement bugs.

There are currently only two Rooms, one based on movement and jumping. The first Room is based on a wall that can be destroyed, and uses the opening to be crushed for hints.
